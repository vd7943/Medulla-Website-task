            At Medulla Flashcards, we believe that learning medicine should be
            both effective and enjoyable. As healthcare professionals and

            postgraduate exams like NEET PG, INICET, and FMGE. That's why we've
            created a platform tailored to meet the needs of aspiring doctors,
            combining advanced learning techniques with a sleek, user-friendly
